//EPISODE 2

// Node is a javascript server .a server is a remote computer machine (may be on cloud or somehwere else
// like a physical location away from everyone ) . when we type google.com out machine(client ) is
// requesting other computer(server) which is hosted on cloud or any other platform .

// before node , javascript is a client side language only , means it is used to run only our browser
// but with node , js can even be a server-can run from anywhere.

//ECMAScript is standard for writing scripting languages and used by many langaues like js etc .
// every platform(chrome , MS , Firefox etc) has their engines . but for a common user who tries
// to execute a js code , he should get the same output no matter where he run . this can only achivec
// only when engines follow certain standard of writing code (like var a = 10 var should only before a)
// V8(ECMASCRIPT) can only execute the code js code . it cannot make network calls to other machine(server)
// Node js is written in cpp and v8 is also is written in cpp , node has v8 embedded along with some other
// super powers(like making apis , network calls connecting to databases etc) - this is know as
// js runtime env  - (v8 + super powers)
