//Node installation , node -v , npm will be automatically installed when we install node .
//when we type node in any terminal - the terminal acts as a engine that can run javascript code
//just like the browser console (used v8 engine) .
//it follows node repl - read , evaluate , print, loop

//the browser gives the global object and its name is window . but node's global object name is global
// the open Js committee decided in 2020 that there should be standard way to represent global
// across varioud platform and globalThis is the keyword they set
